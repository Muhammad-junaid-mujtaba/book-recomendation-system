📚 TensorRecAI – Book Recommendation System


A high-accuracy book recommendation system powered by TensorFlow, trained on user preferences and metadata to suggest personalized reads with 90%+ accuracy.

🚀 Project Overview
TensorRecAI uses deep learning to learn user reading patterns and recommend books based on their interests, genres, ratings, and preferences. It features collaborative filtering with embeddings and a scalable architecture suitable for large book datasets.

✅ Features
🔍 Personalized Recommendations using TensorFlow models.

📈 90%+ accuracy on validation/test data.

📚 Metadata-Based Filtering (genre, author, language, rating).

🧠 Collaborative + Content-Based Filtering Hybrid.

💬 NLP Query Input (Optional) using simple rule-based parsing.

🔄 Easily scalable to millions of books/users.

🧠 Model Architecture
Input: User and Book IDs + Metadata (genre, rating, author)

Embedding Layers: For user and book ID vector representations.

Dense Layers: To learn non-linear user-book interactions.

Output: Recommended top-k books with high predicted preference score.
